# Airbnb Amsterdam Selection

This app uses Numpy to manipulate data and streamlit to create an interactive interface. The dataset includes information on various Bed and Breakfast listings in Amsterdam.

After cleaning and processing the data, I converted prices from US dollars to EUR and adjusted for inflation. Using the provided geo coordinates, I used a vectorized math function to find the listings that are closest to the Van Gogh Museum.

With this app, you can easily find the top Bed and Breakfast options near the museum in Amsterdam.
