Airbnb_Amsterdam_Selection

Numpy first attempt at data manipulation

Created an app with streamilt, inspected data with Numpy, selected Bed and Breakfast close to Van Gogh Museum

After downloading the dataset I performed some cleaning, finding the delimiter to get a matrix and cleaning it up for processing

I converted the US prices in EUR, and using geo coordinates and a vectorized math function I calculated the closest selection to Van Gogh Museum
